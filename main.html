   <H1> Time & Space Complexity </H1>
	<P>Time complexity measures the efficiency of an algorithm by evaluating how its runtime grows as input size increases. Efficient algorithms minimize time complexity, ensuring faster performance, especially with larger datasets.</P>
	<P><B>Space Complexity</B> refers to the amount of memory an algorithm requires relative to its input size. Efficient algorithms aim for lower space complexity, often expressed as O(n), where 'n' represents the input size.</P>
